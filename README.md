Arrhythmias affect 1.5% to 5% of the general population [1]. The most prevalent type of arrhythmia, Atrial fibrillation (AF) which results in fast and irregular heartbeat, affects almost 0.51 percent population. This medical ailment typically has mild symptoms, which makes diagnosis challenging. As a result, an early, precise diagnosis can lower the death rate benefit a variety of treatments.The most popular and reliable method of diagnosing arrhythmias is an electrocardiogram (ECG). It monitors the abnormal electrical activity of the heart and is inexpensive. Yet only a cardiologist and in specific circumstances can use this procedure. To minimize a 12-lead ECG to a single lead, a model is built which seeks to reduce computation and complexity in single lead while still 2 obtaining excellent accuracy for multi-lead. This model is implemented using a knowledge distillation approach, in which the student model acquires knowledge from the teacher model. Under the guidance of the teacher model, the student model is generated using a single lead ECG whereas the teacher model is constructed using a multi-lead ECG. Then, the condensed student model is applied to wearable technology.
